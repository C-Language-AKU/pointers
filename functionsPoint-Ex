1- In a main program, declare two integer variables x and y initialized to 2 and 3.
2- Write the procedure calcul(int a, int b, int * s, int * d, int * p, float * q) which calculates the sum, the difference, the product, and the quotient of the parameters a and b.
3- Call the "calcul" procedure in order to calculate the different operations (addition, ...) on the variables x and y, then display the result.
